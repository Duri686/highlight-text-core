The [CSS Custom Highlight API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Custom_Highlight_API) allows developers to apply custom styles to specific ranges of text in the DOM without modifying the underlying structure. It is particularly useful for advanced text interactions such as search highlighting, annotations, or content editing.
